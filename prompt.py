    "mild_inflammation": 
        'A scan of inflamed cervical tissue showing a dark background, a smooth protective layer, followed by a textured surface layer, and deeper layers with a clear dividing line leading into the stroma.',
    "cyst": 
        'A cervical tissue scan shows a dark background at the top, followed by a thin protective layer. Beneath it lies a clearly textured surface layer. In the middle or lower part of the image, a distinct dark elliptical or curved region is visible, which is characteristic of a cyst.',
    "ectropion": 
        'A cervical tissue scan featuring a dark background at the top, followed by a thin protective layer. Below, distinct clusters of protruding structures are visible, representing the hallmark appearance of columnar epithelium eversion.',
    "high-grade_squamous_intraepithelial_lesion": 
        'A cervical tissue scan displaying advanced lesions characterized by the absence of clear epithelial structures and basal membrane. The image features alternating light and dark vertical streaks resembling icy peak formations, indicating significant structural disruption.',
    "cancer": 
        'A cervical tissue scan indicative of cancer, showing the absence of epithelial and basal membrane layering. The image contains irregular structures and potential clusters resembling cancer nests, with significant disruption in the normal tissue architecture.'
